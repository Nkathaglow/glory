#Description
This is a challenge to evaluate the  basics we've gone through this week.
#Project Setup
So this includes three codes running different programs to output different values.

THE STUDENT GRADE(toy problem)
You have to input the scores such that the only readable scores are between 0 and 100.The inputted score should run so as to give the expected output.The expected outputs are grades ranging from an A to an E as follows:
80 - 100("A"),60 - 79("B"),50 - 59("C"),40 - 49("D"),0 - 40("E")

THE SPEED DETECTOR(toy problem)
For this one i wrote a program that takes 80km/h as the speed,but has a speed limit of 70km/h. For every 5km/h you exceed the speed limit you get a speeding point.This speeding point,these points keep piling till you get upto 13 points.If you you get above twelve speeding poits it's unfortunate but your license shall be suspende.

THE NET SALARY CALCULATOR(toy problem)
i have to write aprogram that calculates the net salary by getting the basic salary and the benefits.You get to use information from KRA for easier understanding together with the NHIF,NSSF deductions so as to get the net salary.
